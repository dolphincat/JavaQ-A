import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner practice = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x;
        String S1, S2, S3;

        System.out.println("Please enter something: ");
        x = practice.nextInt(); // output: next Integer
        S1 = practice.next();   // output: next integer or string or character
        S2 = practice.nextLine(); /*output: the rest of the sentence on the same line,
                                            if the line is empty then it display nothing */
        S3 = practice.nextLine(); // move to the rest of the line

        System.out.println("x is " + x);
        System.out.println("S1 is " + S1);
        System.out.println("S2 is " + S2);
        System.out.println("S3 is " + S3);

    }
}


Here is the output when I run the program:
Please enter something: 
1 Alexa please play music
Volume up!

x is 1
S1 is Alexa
S2 is  please play music
S3 is Volume up!
